* Draw command buffer

* Other triangle filling techniques other than barycentric filling

* Particle system

* Allow arbitary FOV

* NOTES: 
  - Can I clip triangles before projecting them on the the viewport? 
  - I think I can clip them when we issue the draw call and just maintain a buffer of triangles to draw
    at a later time in the frame.
  - What should a rasterization pass look like?
    - Gather triangles, clip, transform, draw?
    - Gather triangles per-model?
